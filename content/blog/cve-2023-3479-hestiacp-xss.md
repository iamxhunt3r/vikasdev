# CVE-2023-3479: Reflected XSS in HestiaCP

## Introduction

During my security research activities, I discovered a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in HestiaCP, a popular web hosting control panel. This vulnerability was assigned **CVE-2023-3479** and has been officially documented in the National Vulnerability Database.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3479  
**CVSS Score:** 6.1 (Medium)  
**Vulnerability Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
**Affected Software:** HestiaCP  

## Discovery Process

The vulnerability was discovered during a routine security assessment of the HestiaCP interface. I noticed that certain user input parameters were not properly sanitized before being reflected back in the HTTP response.

### Technical Analysis

The vulnerability exists in the web interface where user-supplied input is reflected back to the user without proper encoding or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the victim's browser context.

**Vulnerable Parameter:** The vulnerability was found in a specific parameter that handles user input for administrative functions.

**Attack Vector:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript payload and trick an administrator into clicking it.

## Proof of Concept

\`\`\`javascript
// Example payload (sanitized for educational purposes)
<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected')</script>
\`\`\`

When this payload is properly crafted and embedded in the vulnerable parameter, it executes in the context of the HestiaCP administrative interface.

## Impact Assessment

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to:

- Steal session cookies and authentication tokens
- Perform administrative actions on behalf of the victim
- Redirect users to malicious websites
- Inject malicious content into the administrative interface

## Remediation

The vulnerability has been addressed by the HestiaCP development team through:

1. **Input Validation:** Implementing proper input validation for all user-supplied parameters
2. **Output Encoding:** Ensuring all user input is properly encoded before being reflected in responses
3. **Content Security Policy:** Implementing CSP headers to mitigate XSS attacks

## Timeline

- **Discovery Date:** March 2023
- **Vendor Notification:** March 2023
- **CVE Assignment:** June 2023
- **Public Disclosure:** July 2023

## Lessons Learned

This discovery reinforces the importance of:

- Regular security assessments of web applications
- Proper input validation and output encoding
- Following secure coding practices
- Implementing defense-in-depth security measures
